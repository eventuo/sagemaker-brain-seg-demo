    "This notebook shows how to apply image segmentation algorithms to medical imaging use-cases in a simple, streamlined way using Amazon SageMaker. Specifically, we'll be using Apache MXNet to train a convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation on SageMaker using the \"Bring Your Own Script\" paradigm. Put simply, the goal of semantic segmentation is to make classifications on an image at the pixel-level, producing a classification \"mask.\" We will train two networks, U-Net and ENet. We'll show how to deploy these models to inference endpoints, both in the cloud on Amazon SageMaker and at the edge using AWS GreenGrass.\n",

    "\n",
    "Medical imaging techniques allow medical professionals to see inside the human body, but more often than not the professional needs precise segmentation of the tissues within the image for analytical procedures and inferences. This is particular relevant in use-cases where volumetric and surface analysis are key to derive insights from the raw imaging, such as assessing the cardivascular health of a patient. Typically, this segmentation is done manually by medical professionals, and is very time consuming. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been shown to be highly performant at this task, and in this notebook we'll train two such networks to automatically segment brain tissue from
